# Calisthenics Workout App
A fitness app MVP created using react-native which can be scaled easily. 

## Run
    - yarn install
    - yarn run ios/android

## Motivation
I wanted to help fitness industry to come up with great apps whether it is related to physical or mental. Anyone can use the repo and scale up to the required needs. 

## Help
- I have been working on this app on and off. 
- May be my code haven't been up not to the mark or missed some obvious cases as I had very less time. 
- Due to the lack of time I am looking for community help to improve the project. 

## Contribution
I am not following any specific pattern for PR, just follow the basics.
